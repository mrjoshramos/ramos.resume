    <h1>Two Decades of Work</h1>
    <h2>"The Best is Yet to Come"</h2>
    <h2>1. Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>A life filled with material things alone will not be remembered. Our impact in the limited time that we have is all that matters.
            My mission in life if to do far more good than bad - to leave the world just slightly better than I found it. In career, this means
            bringing ideas to life, and giving back along the way. We should all strive to find our greatest potential, before we are no longer 
            able to do so.
        </p>

    <h2>4. Timeline</h2>
        <h3>The Early Years</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>The headline "Two Decades of Work" is a nod at the fact that my sales career started extremely early. The first sales I can recall
                    happened when I was 8 years old selling Pokemon cards door to door to other kids in the neighborhood. This was not a very profitable
                    endeavor, but it was wildly successful because it funded my Pokemon collecting hobby.
                </p>
                <p>This narrative would continue throughout my teenage years. Everything from selling car washes and mowing lawns, to selling kitchen 
                    knives with Cutco during the summer. Sales and entrepreneurship is wired into my DNA. This has carried over into the last decade of work
                    as I have taken those entrepreurial tendencies to execute in every role I have held.
                </p>
            </ul>
        <h3>The Last Decade</h3>
            <ul>
                <h4>Telecom</h4>
                    <p>The first 2 years of my tech sales career were in telecom - B2B wireless sales and then networking. I learned a lot of 
                        great things in this period, but I didn't feel challenged in my day to day.
                        </p>
                <h4>Colocation & IaaS</h4>
                    <p>Through relationships I had built, I found my way into a company called Peer 1 Hosting (later known as Cogeco Peer 1).
                        This was my first introduction to Hosted Infrastructure aka Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). I would spend several years
                        selling colocation and Vmware based IaaS solutions to a variety of customers ranging from SMB into Mid-Market / Commerical
                        businesses. Some deals were $2K/mo. while others were $50k/mo. or more.
                    </p>
                <h4>Hyperscaler - Microsoft</h4>
                    <p>The last three years has been spent at Microsoft, where I moved from SMC with 90 accounts into Strategics with only one 
                        Enterprise account and taking said account from $26M/yr. to over $50M/yr. This time at Microsoft has been a master-class on 
                        closing large deals through incredible competition, while learning how to navigate a $2T organization. I'm 10x better today than
                        this time 3 years ago, and I still have much to learn.
                    </p>
